# leaflet-challenge
In this project, I used javascript and d3 to create a map based on earthquake data from the Unites States Geological Survey. This map focuses on the magnitude and depth of the earthquakes. The size of the markers are based on the magnitude value, and the color of the markers represents the depth of the earthquakes. 

The files with my code and html can be found in the Stater_code folder. My code for creating the map can be found in the logic.js file located in the static folder. The data I used in the project can be found using this url: https://earthquake.usgs.gov/earthquakes/feed/v1.0/summary/significant_month.geojson
